# Robot Shield Project

This project is part of the ZLab hardware assessment.

It includes:
- An **Arduino program** for reading distance using the **HC-SR05 ultrasonic sensor**
- A **custom library** written without using any external ultrasonic libraries
- A **PCB design** created in **Altium Designer** based on the **ATmega328** microcontroller
